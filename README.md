# mastery-chs: Chalmers Master's Thesis template in Typst

A thesis template for Master Thesises at
[Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) (except CSE/GU students).
More or less a port of the
[provided LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/chalmers-university-of-technology-degree-project-report-template-2023-english/tffgsvqnhxmv), although
not a 100% faithful one.
